		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>Hi! I'm James Putnam and this is my cool website which will host a lot of things from a resume and portfolio of my work to some goofy projects that I do for fun. I also plan to include a blog somewhere (or maybe a web comic, if I'm feeling artistic) so stay tuned for that. Feel free to poke around and see my work, and thanks for stopping by!</p>
