		<p> This is my website. thanks for coming by, i plan to put some javascript or something here. I'm not quite sure yet what that will look like, but only time will tell. I was thinking of starting with something simple, maybe a clock, some basic buttons that changed a variable, things like that. After that, I want to develop a small game </p>
