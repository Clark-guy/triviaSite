# Yikes website

## layout

This website is comprised of **two** main portions. A portion made by julia which
makes up most of the website, and has a blue background, as well as the
portion made by james, which has the beige background. The main site functions
as the site for our band, whereas the james portion is just where james screws
around for funsies. take a look at our music and pics and have a good time!

## hosting

At the time of writing this, the site is hosted at ['yikes.pizza'](http://yikes.pizza/). The ssl
certificate may not be updated yet, so if your browser yells at you for going
here, no need to worry. There's no place on the site where you could put any 
particularly sensitive information, so you'll be fine.

*Have a good day! you're the best!*
