# Yikes website

## layout

This website is comprised of **two** main portions. A portion made by julia which
makes up most of the website, and has a blue background, as well as the
portion made by james, which has the beige background. The main site functions
as the site for our band, whereas the james portion is just where james screws
around for funsies. take a look at our music and pics and have a good time!
